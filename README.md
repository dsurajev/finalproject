# Django notes app

A note app that let's you add notes, view them, edit them and finally - delete them. User must be logged in to perform these actions. 

For styling of the app I used MUMBLE UI kit - https://github.com/divanov11/Mumble/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDE.md

To load the app and make it work in your environment please refer to requirements.txt file
